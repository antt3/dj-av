## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This project is meant to be a website for my brother's DJ business.


The calender portion of the site was built using **[this](https://dev.to/timfee/build-and-host-your-own-calendy-like-scheduling-page-using-nextjs-and-google-apis-5ack)** tutorial.
It works like this:
1. A user requests an appointment.
2. The system emails him asking him to confirm or deny.
3. Once confirmed, it's emailed to the user and added to both of your calendars. 

Some technical notes:
* Uses Next.js 13 and Typescript with Tailwind.
* Has some testing on the more tricky functions.
